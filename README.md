An API developed to test knowledge and to create an API where each 
user can make fueling entries for their cars.

### Resume

The idea is to create a Java Spring API where a flutter application 
will consume its resources. This API will be responsible for login,
user control, car registration and launch of car supplies, among other 
things that will be developed in order to test knowledge.

## üöÄ Getting started

### Requirements

1. Java 21
